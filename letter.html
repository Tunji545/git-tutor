            <p>
              I am grateful for the opportunity granted me to be part of this
              program. It was a wonderful experience meeting you and your team,
              learning under such a conducive environment, and also the quality
              of the learning sections were second to not.
            </p>
            <p>
              A brief introduction of myself. I am a graduate of Chemistry
              department. I completed the mandatory one year national service in
              the year, 2020. Right from my undergraduade days, I had a strong
              interest to becoming a senior developer. This led me to enroll for
              some online courses on HTML, CSS, JavaScript,
              <del>Material UI</del> and React, from some of the leading
              distance learning organisations like FreeCodeCamp and Coursera.
              With determination and hardwork, I am able to earn above five
              certifications across the above listed languages. Also, I was
              opportuned to get a paid internship offer from the famous ICT
              company, <mark>Prunedge<sub>6</sub></mark
              >. The training lasted for six months. As a result, I was exposed
              to what working on a real project in a formal setting entails.
              Needless to say, I believe I am in a better position to scale
              through this intership program.
